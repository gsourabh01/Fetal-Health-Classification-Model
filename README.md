# Fetal-Health-Classification-Model
Cardiotocography (CTG) is used during pregnancy to monitor fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. It is monitor fetal well-being and allows early detection of fetal distress.  In this project, I will create a model to classify the outcome of Cardiotocogram test to ensure the well being of the fetus.
